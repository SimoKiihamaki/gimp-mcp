Below is a **Tech Stack Document** outlining the tools, frameworks, libraries, and platforms recommended for developing the **GIMP AI Integration Addon and MCP Server**. This document provides an overview of each selected technology, why it was chosen, and how it fits into the overall system architecture.

---

**Tech Stack Document**

  

**1. Overview**

  

The AI Integration for GIMP relies on two primary components:

1. **GIMP Plugin (Frontend)**: A Python-based plugin that integrates with GIMP’s menu system and user interface.

2. **MCP Server (Backend)**: A Python (or alternative language) server that exposes MCP endpoints, processes image data, and interacts with AI models.

  

This tech stack ensures a cohesive, cross-platform experience while leveraging popular, well-supported libraries for AI, network communication, and image processing.

---

**2. Programming Languages**

  

**2.1 Python (Primary Choice)**

• **Version**: 3.8+ recommended (to ensure continued support and compatibility with key libraries).

• **Reasons**:

• GIMP’s scripting API supports Python for plugin development.

• Python is the de facto language for many AI frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow).

• A rich ecosystem of libraries (image processing, web frameworks) aligns with project needs.

  

**2.2 Other Potential Languages (Optional)**

• **C/C++**: Typically for GIMP core/plugins that require performance-critical tasks, but for this project, Python is usually sufficient.

• **JavaScript / TypeScript (Optional)**: Could be used in the event of creating additional tooling, integration with the ChatGPT MCP on macOS, or for front-end dashboards.

• **Shell Scripts**: For installation or deployment on Linux/macOS.

---

**3. Frameworks and Libraries**

  

**3.1 GIMP Plugin Stack**

• **GIMP Python API (PyGIMP)**

• Provides direct access to GIMP’s image manipulation functions, layer management, filters, etc.

• Entry point for creating menu entries, dialogs, and calling GIMP’s Procedural Database (PDB).

• **GTK / PyGObject** (Version depends on GIMP release)

• Used for creating dialogs and UI elements within the GIMP plugin.

• Offers standard widgets (sliders, text fields, etc.) for parameter inputs.

  

**3.2 Server-Side / MCP Layer**

• **Flask or FastAPI** (Python)

• Used to implement an HTTP server providing JSON-RPC endpoints.

• **Flask** is lightweight and has a simple learning curve.

• **FastAPI** offers built-in async support, automatic docs (OpenAPI), and high performance.

• **JSON-RPC 2.0**

• A specification for remote procedure calls using JSON.

• Libraries like **json-rpc** (Flask extension) or built-in solutions can simplify request/response handling.

• The protocol aligns with the Model Context Protocol’s requirements.

• **Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets** (Optional)

• For streaming progress updates from long-running AI tasks back to the GIMP plugin.

• **Flask-SSE** or **uvicorn / Starlette** (with FastAPI) for server push mechanics.

  

**3.3 AI Frameworks and Toolkits**

• **PyTorch** (Recommended 1.12+ or 2.x)

• Large ecosystem, widely used, strong community support.

• Supports a range of models (stable diffusion, inpainting, super-resolution).

• **TensorFlow** (Optional alternative)

• Another mature ecosystem for deep learning.

• If the team already uses TF-based models, might be more convenient.

• **OpenVINO** (Optional if Intel-based optimization is needed)

• Speeds up inference on Intel hardware.

• Integrates with various deep learning models, but adds extra configuration steps.

• **Model-Specific Wrappers**

• For tasks like stable diffusion (e.g., [Hugging Face Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)), ESRGAN for upscaling, etc.

  

**3.4 Image Processing and Serialization**

• **Pillow (PIL)**

• Python Imaging Library for basic image conversions, resizing, format changes.

• Commonly used to handle data bridging between GIMP plugin and AI model.

• **NumPy**

• De facto standard for array/tensor manipulation in Python.

• Integral for data interchange (e.g., from Pillow to PyTorch, etc.).

• **base64**

• Standard Python module (base64) to serialize images when sending them over JSON-RPC.

---

**4. Databases and Storage (If Needed)**

• Typically, **no persistent database** is required for an on-demand AI editing service, as images are processed in memory or stored temporarily on disk.

• However, you may use:

• **SQLite or Lightweight DB**: If user wants to store model metadata, usage logs, or history of edits.

• **File System Storage**: For caching large intermediate AI results or storing pre-downloaded AI models.

---

**5. DevOps and Deployment**

  

**5.1 Packaging & Distribution**

• **Python Virtual Environment**

• Recommended to isolate plugin/server dependencies from system Python.

• Tools: venv, pipenv, or conda.

• **Docker Containers** (Optional)

• If you want to deploy a self-contained image for the MCP server, encapsulating Python, AI models, and dependencies.

• **Installers / Scripts**

• For ease of user installation on Windows, macOS, and Linux, shell or .bat scripts can automate copying plugin files into GIMP’s plugin directory and installing Python dependencies.

  

**5.2 Version Control & CI/CD**

• **Git + GitHub/GitLab**

• Collaboration, code reviews, issue tracking.

• **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI**

• Automated testing and building for cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

• Possibly automated publishing of Docker images or plugin zip files.

---

**6. Security and Encryption**

• **HTTPS / TLS**

• If the MCP server is accessed remotely, we recommend TLS encryption for JSON-RPC data.

• **Authentication Tokens** (Optional)

• If running a multi-user environment or an open network.

• **Localhost-only**

• Simplifies security if the server is restricted to local access (no external exposures).

---

**7. Optional Integrations**

• **macOS ChatGPT MCP Integration**

• If needed, use **Bun** or **Node.js** scripts on macOS to call AppleScript or system-level commands.

• The GIMP plugin can send requests to the ChatGPT MCP tool or vice versa.

• **VS Code / Editor Plugins**

• Could allow editing or debugging the plugin code more conveniently.

---

**8. Rationale and Considerations**

1. **Python-Centric**:

• GIMP plugin development is most straightforward using Python.

• Major AI frameworks are also Python-based, unifying the stack.

2. **FastAPI (or Flask)**:

• Quick to develop, widely documented, easy to integrate with JSON-based protocols.

• Asynchronous capabilities and built-in SSE/WebSocket support (particularly in FastAPI) to handle longer AI tasks.

3. **PyTorch**:

• Vibrant community, frequent updates, robust model ecosystem.

• Easy local GPU acceleration with CUDA.

• Alternatively, TensorFlow can be used if that better fits the team’s experience or existing model base.

4. **No RDBMS Necessity**:

• Image data is processed on the fly. Typically, no long-term data storage is required beyond ephemeral caching.

5. **Ease of Extensibility**:

• By using a well-known Python framework plus PyTorch/TensorFlow, additional models or features can be integrated with minimal friction.

• SSE or WebSockets can be added later if real-time progress or advanced collaboration features are desired.

---

**9. Summary**

  

The **Tech Stack** for the GIMP AI Integration Addon and MCP Server emphasizes:

• **Python** for both the GIMP plugin and the MCP server, ensuring a consistent language environment.

• **Flask or FastAPI** for implementing the MCP server, providing JSON-RPC endpoints for image manipulation and AI tasks.

• **PyTorch (or TensorFlow)** as the main AI framework for local inference.

• **Pillow / NumPy** for efficient image data handling and conversion.

• **GTK/PyGObject** (or GIMP’s own UI APIs) to create user-facing dialogs and parameter inputs.

  

This setup offers a robust, extensible foundation that caters to different OSes (Windows, macOS, Linux) and a variety of AI model capabilities. It also ensures that developers can readily add, modify, or replace AI features without changing the core plugin-server communication pattern.
