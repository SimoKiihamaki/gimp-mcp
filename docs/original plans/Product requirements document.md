**5. User Stories & Use Cases**

1. **Story: Quick Object Removal**

• _As a graphic designer, I want to remove unwanted objects from an image quickly, so I can produce a clean final design without manually masking._

• **Acceptance Criteria**: Selecting an area in GIMP and invoking “AI Inpainting” should remove the object within a new layer.

2. **Story: AI-Assisted Style Transfer**

• _As an artist, I want to apply a ‘Van Gogh’ style to my photograph directly in GIMP, so I can see immediate creative results._

• **Acceptance Criteria**: A new menu item for “AI Style Transfer” with an adjustable “strength” parameter.

3. **Story: Text-to-Image Generation**

• _As a casual user, I want to generate an image from a text prompt (e.g., “A sunset over a mountain range with vivid colors”), so I can experiment with AI image generation._

• **Acceptance Criteria**: A dialog that accepts a text prompt, calls the AI model, and places the generated image on a new layer/canvas.

4. **Story: High-Resolution Upscaling**

• _As a photographer, I want to upscale an old low-resolution image to a higher resolution without losing detail._

• **Acceptance Criteria**: An “AI Upscale” option that outputs a higher resolution layer with minimal artifacts.

**6. Competitive / Comparative Analysis**

• **libreearth/gimp-mcp**: A foundational project that integrates MCP with GIMP. Offers a reference for basic AI calls but lacks extensive AI features and robust documentation.

• **Adobe Photoshop AI Plugins** (proprietary): Provide advanced AI features; we aim to offer similar functionalities in an open-source ecosystem.

• **Krita AI Plugins**: Certain community plugins exist but are not standardized under MCP. Observing their user experience can guide design choices.

---

**7. Technical Architecture**

1. **GIMP Python Plugin**

• **Components**:

• gimp_mcp_plugin.py: Registers new menu items and dialogs.

• gimp_mcp_client.py: Sends JSON-RPC calls to the MCP server.

• **Workflow**:

1. User selects a menu item (e.g., AI Inpainting).

2. Plugin gathers relevant image data (selection, active layer).

3. Plugin sends request to MCP Server with operation details.

4. Plugin receives response (modified image data or references).

5. Plugin updates the GIMP canvas/layers accordingly.

6. **MCP Server**

• **Main Modules**:

• server.py: Handles incoming HTTP requests or WebSocket connections.

• handlers/: Contains logic for each AI operation (inpainting, style transfer, etc.).

• gimp_api_interface.py: Wraps calls to GIMP Python API methods.

• ai_backends/: Integrates different AI models (e.g., stable_diffusion.py, openvino_enhance.py).

• **Workflow**:

1. MCP client (GIMP plugin) sends JSON-RPC requests.

2. server.py parses request, routes to appropriate handler.

3. Handler calls gimp_api_interface for image operations or ai_backends for AI tasks.

4. Handler returns response to plugin via JSON-RPC (and optional SSE updates).

5. **macOS ChatGPT MCP Integration** _(Optional or Future Scope)_

• **Objective**: Let GIMP plugin communicate with the ChatGPT MCP tool.

• **Method**: Possibly via local HTTP endpoints or by listening to prompts from ChatGPT.

• **Use Case**: Have ChatGPT “explain” or “suggest” edits in GIMP context.
